# A little insight into JJGypsy
Hi everyone, My name is, well in net its **JJGypsy**. This README will give you a bit of information about me.

# My Career Passion
I really love working in tech. Specifically, i love being in a position where I can help others build something amazing! Whether thats being a manager, or working with customers and relaying that information back to the developers, that is my sweet spot! I enjoy teaching and learning, so any role that enables me to flex my education muscles is the rightrole for me, thats why I really enjoy writing these books!

# My Hobbies
One of my favourite things to do is to go to Disneyland - even if I didnt go on any rides, just walking around the park and feeling the magic is enough for me.
P.S. this is from the book "Github for Dummies"

## The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown
I absolutely love The Da Vinci Code book, basically all of *Dan Brown's books*. They are so engaging and rich. What is even better is the community that has formed around it. Lately, I've been listening to podcasts that do deep dive into the entire ***Dan Brown universe*** and it is so much fun.
